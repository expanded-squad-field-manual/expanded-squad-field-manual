# Random Advance and Secure (RAAS)
Random Advance and Secure is the most common gamemode in Squad. In this gamemode, both teams start at their respective
parts of the map at their uncapturable **Main Objective**, and must capture the first neutral objective to reveal the next objective, and so on.

Most maps have seven objectives total, but some smaller ones have five. Objectives can be predicted on some layers by the direction the known objectives have taken, this is usually
referred to as a **Lane**. Some Lanes are very predictable on some Layers, and others have lanes which wildly vary.

The objectives until the ones close to the center of the map are usually called **Backcaps**, and the act of capturing them toward the center of the map is called **Back-capping*.

Some Layers are characterized by one team having quite unpredictable objectives, and the other team only having to capture one objective before knowing where the rest of the objectives are.
Additionally, some layers have **Guaranteed Objectives** which are predictable to both teams. You may have to expect these objectives to be rushed by the enemy for them to ambush and saboage you, and
you should play cautiously and anticipate this. Never assume a Backcap is safe.

Objectives are only revealed if you capture the objective before it. If your team captures an objective and reveals the next, and then loses the same objective, the revealed objective will still remain visible.
You can only capture an enemy objective if you have captured the one preceeding it.

When a point is initially captured from neutral at the start of the game, the team gains 20 tickets for **initial objective captures**. Capturing points held by the enemy gains the attacing team 60 tickets.
This means capturing a **midcap** (the point in the center of the map) isn't of exceptional importance, as the initial capture only gains 20 tickets over the enemy.
Points which are neutralized by the enemy and then recaptured by your team do not gain the team the 20 ticket initial cap bonus, the team will only gain tickets if the enemy fully captures that point and the defending team fully captures it back.

# Double Neutral

In the scenario of two objectives, one held by the friendly team, and the other held by an enemy, if both teams attack the enemy team's objectives at the same time, they can neutralize both objectives.
This means both teams are unable to capture the next enemy objectives after, and the neutralized objectives will become stuckk in this state until either team recapture their own defense objective.
In this scenario, it does not matter how many enemies are on the friendly neutralized objective, as long as three players of either team are inside the capture zone of their objective, they can recapture it
and then threaten the objective they had neutralized. This means a top priority for a team which is in a double neutral situation is to recapture their neutralized objective with at least 3 people, otherwise the enemy
can recapture theirs and then threaten the objective.

# Fog of War

Some Severs may disable the Fog of War feature, which means all capture points will be known to both teams immediately. This replicates the gameplay of Advance and Secure, while keeping the objective variance of Random Advance and Secure.
