# Invasion

Invasion is like **Random Advance and Secure**, but instead of both teams being equal in their ability to capture objectives, there is a **Defending** and **Attacking** team.

The Attackers start with far less tickets than the Defenders, but can gain more tickets by capturing the Defender's objectives. Once a Defenders objective has been captured, the Defenders can no longer recapture that objective, and the next defense objective is revealed for the attackers.
Attackers can win the match by either capturing the Defender's last point, depleting their tickets to zero, or by depleting the Defending team's tickets to zero via other means.
The Defenders start with 800 or 1000 tickekts, and can see all of their objectives from the start of the game. The Defending team wins by depleting the Attacker's tickets to zero, or allowing the match timer to deplete before the Attackers are able to capture the Defending team's final objective.


# Fog of War

Some Severs may disable the Fog of War feature, which means all capture points will be known to the attacking team immediately.
